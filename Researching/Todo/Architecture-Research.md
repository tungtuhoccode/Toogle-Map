## 1. Data Storage & Graph Construction

### a. Choosing a Spatial Database

* **PostGIS + pgRouting**

  * **Pros**: Mature, full SQL support, rich spatial functions, built-in network topology via pgRouting.
  * **Cons**: Requires PostgreSQL setup and tuning for large networks.
* **Specialized Routing Engines**

  * **OSRM (C++)** or **GraphHopper (Java)** both ingest OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, preprocess it into highly optimized contraction hierarchies, and expose HTTP APIs.
  * **Pros**: Blazing-fast queries, turn restrictions, traffic integration.
  * **Cons**: More complex deployment, heavyweight C++/Java runtime.
* **Document Stores (MongoDB)**

  * You *can* store GeoJSON edges in a geospatially indexed collection, then implement your own graph lookup in application code.
  * **Pros**: Simpler if you already use MongoDB; flexible JSON schema.
  * **Cons**: No built-in routing; you’ll reimplement nearest-node lookup, adjacency, and indexing yourself.

### b. Graph Schema & Indexing

* **Node/Edge Tables** (in PostGIS):

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE ways (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    source INTEGER,
    target INTEGER,
    cost DOUBLE PRECISION,
    geom  geometry(LineString, 4326)
  );
  CREATE INDEX ON ways USING GIST(geom);
  ```
* **Topology**: Use `pgr_createTopology('ways', tolerance)` to assign `source`/`target` node IDs and build the network graph.
* **Spatial Indexes**: Always index your nodes table on the point geometry, and edges on their linestrings, to enable fast nearest‐neighbor and bounding‐box lookups.

## 2. Algorithm Selection & Optimization

### a. Basic Algorithms

* **Dijkstra**: Guaranteed shortest path; O(|E| + |V| log |V|) with a binary heap. Suitable for small to medium networks or one-off queries.
* **A\***: Heuristic‐driven (e.g. straight-line distance) to dramatically prune the search space. Best for single queries on large graphs if you have a good admissible heuristic (e.g. Haversine).

### b. Advanced Speed-ups

* **Contraction Hierarchies (CH)**: Preprocess the graph by “contracting” nodes into shortcuts; queries become lightning-fast (\~microseconds). Employed by OSRM and GraphHopper.
* **ALT (A\* + Landmarks + Triangle inequality)**: Precompute distances from a handful of landmark nodes to all others; use that as an A\* heuristic.
* **Multi-level (HL)** & **Transit Node Routing**: Partition the graph into cells or hierarchical clusters for regional vs global queries.
* **Incremental / Real-time Updates**: If you need live traffic, use dynamic weight adjustment or incremental CH updates, though these are more complex.

  A[OSM / GeoJSON Source] --> B[Ingestion & Topology]
  B --> C[Spatial Database (PostGIS + pgRouting)]
  B --> D[Routing Engine (OSRM/GraphHopper)]
  C & D --> E[API Layer]
  E --> F[Client (MapLibre, Leaflet, etc.)]
```

1. **Ingestion**

   * Download OSM PBF or your GeoJSON.
   * Load into PostGIS or feed into OSRM’s `osrm-extract` / GraphHopper’s importer.
2. **Preprocessing**

   * In PostGIS: run `pgr_createTopology` + optional `pgr_analyzeGraph`.
   * In OSRM: `osrm-contract` to build CH.
3. **API Layer**

   * Expose endpoints for:

     * `/route?start=…&end=…`
     * `/nearest?point=…` (to snap user click to nearest graph node)
     * Optional: `/table` for many‐to‐many distances.
4. **Client Integration**

   * Use MapLibre GL or Leaflet to display a vector‐tile basemap.
   * On click: send lat/lon to your `/nearest`, then `/route`, then render the returned polyline or GeoJSON.

## 4. Front-end & GeoJSON Storage Considerations

### a. Serving GeoJSON vs Vector Tiles

* **GeoJSON**: Fine for small areas or light use; client downloads the full geometry.
* **Vector Tiles (MBTiles)**:

  * Pre‐tile with Tippecanoe or Tegola into an `.mbtiles` container.
  * Serve via a lightweight tile server (TileServer GL, tegola, or your own Node/Go server).
  * **Pros**: Only fetches what you need per viewport/zoom; fast and cacheable.
  * **Cons**: Preprocessing step; need tile server.

### b. Caching & Performance

* **Server-side caching** of routing responses for repeated queries.
* **Client-side caching** of vector tile layers (via Service Worker or HTTP Cache).
* **Batch queries**: If your users plot multiple routes at once (e.g. batch delivery optimization), use the `/table` endpoint in pgRouting or OSRM.

| SQL-centric, moderate scale      | PostGIS + pgRouting          | `pgr_dijkstra` or `pgr_astar`    | Full SQL, flexible | Medium performance     |
| High-performance, OSM-based      | OSRM or GraphHopper          | Contraction Hierarchies + A\*    | Ultra-fast queries | More complex to deploy |
| Real-time traffic & dynamic data | Custom in-memory C++ engine  | Dynamic CH or re-optimized graph | Real-time updates  | Very complex           |

### Key Takeaways & Recommendations

1. **For most projects**, start with **PostGIS + pgRouting**:

   * One command to load GeoJSON.
   * Use `pgr_astar` for speed.
   * Easy integration with SQL analytics.

2. **When you need scale** (nation-wide or frequent queries):

   * Deploy **OSRM** or **GraphHopper**.
   * Benefit from out-of-the-box CH, turn restrictions, traffic.

3. **Front-end**:

   * Serve your map layers as **vector tiles** (MBTiles + tile server).
   * Keep routing logic on the server; expose a simple HTTP API.

4. **Advanced**:

   * Precompute contraction hierarchies.
   * Add landmarks (ALT) for A\* heuristics.
   * Partition your graph for parallel queries or microservices.

By combining a spatially indexed database (or specialized engine) with the right shortest-path algorithm and efficient front-end delivery via vector tiles, you’ll have a robust, scalable routing solution.
